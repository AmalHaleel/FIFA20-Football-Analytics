# FIFA20-Football-Analytics

 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **FIFA 20 player dataset** to explore football skills, cluster players based on attributes, and answer key analytical questions.  
It covers **EDA, clustering, and predictive modeling**, with clear visualizations and insights.

 Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on FIFA 20 dataset  
- Clustering players based on skills (KMeans, PCA visualization)  
- Insights on player performance, age trends & wages  
- Model comparison to find the best predictive approach  
- Challenges faced and solutions explained  

Analysis Tasks
1. Rank top 10 countries with the most FIFA 20 players  
2. Study the relationship between **Overall Rating vs Age**  
3. Compare wages among **ST, RW, LW** positions  
4. Cluster players into meaningful groups based on attributes  

 
Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

 Challenges Faced
- Handling missing values & categorical encoding  
- Feature scaling & dimensionality reduction  
- Choosing the right number of clusters  
- Comparing model performances fairly  

## üèÅ Conclusion  
This project provided insights into FIFA 20 players through **EDA, clustering, and modeling**. 
We identified top football nations,player peak age, wage trends, and grouped players by skills. 
The study shows how data science can turn football stats into meaningful insights.
